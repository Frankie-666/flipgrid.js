flipgrid.js is a simple, content-focused photo gallery inspired by Microsoft's Metro interface and CSS 3D transitions. Therefore, it only works in browsers that support CSS3D.

Visit http://t3hprogrammer.github.com/flipgrid.js for a demo.

To see it in action (in Chrome), serve `index.html` and visit it in your browser.
The easiest way is to install python, open a terminal, navigate to the directory you cloned `flipgrid.js`, and run

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and visit 

	localhost:8000

in your browser. Firefox users can simply just open `index.html` in Firefox.
